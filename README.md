# ArtisanAware
With Generative AI, we may not know which image are drawn or photographed by an artist.  This project hope to help artist to understand the capabilities of Generative AI. Hence, this will help him/her to capture photos or produce artwork that excels the limits of generative AI.  Art is the expression of human being who is alive and living.

Here is the video demo of this project: https://youtu.be/UtgoTwVOC-M

Below are the steps to help Artisan to be Aware of Generative AI capability:
1. Artist upload his/her photo or artwork
2. Using Generative AI to derive his/her photo or artwork the detailed description using Generative AI
3. Using this obtained description and Generative AI to generate 5 images and display them for artist to view
4. Compare the similarity of original image with the generated

Note: 
* As this project is still experimental phase.
* Best run in Google's [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

This project is based on 3 Generative AIs:
* Google's Gemini - [Gemini API: Quickstart with Python](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart)
* HuggingFace Stable Diffusion - [How to build a text to image app with free AI model in 30 lines of code](https://trojrobert.medium.com/how-to-build-a-text-to-image-app-with-free-ai-model-in-30-lines-of-code-f12c8a2f727f)
* CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) from the openAI - [Exploring Image Similarity Approaches in Python](https://medium.com/scrapehero/exploring-image-similarity-approaches-in-python-b8ca0a3ed5a3) Medium article.
